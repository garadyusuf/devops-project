# Microservice Deployment to Kubernetes 🚀


Welcome to my personal project repository! Here, I showcase my work on deploying a **Python** microservice to **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** with **CI/CD automation**. This project utilises **Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions**, and **Kubernetes** for deployment, and incorporates monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**. 🌐




What This Project Is About:
- Deploy a Python Flask application to Kubernetes. 
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to build and push the Docker image using GitHub Actions.
- Provision the Kubernetes cluster using Terraform and configure custom domain routing via Ingress. 
- Configure Cloud DNS for managing a custom domain pointing to the Kubernetes services.
- Automate Prometheus and Grafana installations for monitoring and observability.
