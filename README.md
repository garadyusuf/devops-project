🛠️ Microservice Deployment to Kubernetes: Personal Project 🚀
Welcome to my personal project repository! Here, I showcase my work on deploying a Python microservice to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with full CI/CD automation. This project leverages Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes for deployment, and incorporates monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. 🌐

What This Project Is About:
This repository contains everything needed to:
Deploy a simple Python Flask application to Kubernetes.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to build and push the Docker image using GitHub Actions.
Provision the Kubernetes cluster using Terraform and configure custom domain routing via Ingress.
Automate Prometheus and Grafana installations for monitoring and observability.
Configure Cloud DNS for managing a custom domain pointing to the Kubernetes services. 🌍
